# 🧮 Calculator System – Forked & Enhanced by Sania Irshad

## 📌 Introduction

This project is a fork of the original calculator system developed by **[Shumaila](https://github.com/shumaila1823)**. It is a simple command-line calculator created using **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. I have forked and enhanced this version to support my learning in Python and GitHub collaboration.

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and keeps running until the user decides to exit.

## ⭐ Features

- ✅ User-friendly command-line interface
- ➕ Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- 🧱 Organized class-based structure
- 🔁 Continuous execution until user quits
- ⚠️ Handles invalid input and division by zero
- 🪶 Lightweight and runs with core Python (no external libraries)

🔬 Scientific Calculator Features:

1.Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan, cot, and their inverses.

2.Logarithmic Functions: log, ln, antilog.

3.Exponents and Roots: Powers (x^y), square root, nth root.

4.Factorial: n! for combinatorics and permutations.

5.Constants: π, e, and other mathematical constants.

6.Memory Functions: Store, recall, and clear memory.

7.Complex Numbers: Handle real and imaginary numbers (a + bi).

8.Scientific Notation: Display and accept input in 1.23e+4 form.

9.Unit Conversions: Length, mass, time, temperature, etc.

⚙️ How the Program Works
Define the Class:

A class Calculator is created with methods for each operation: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() etc.

2. The program:
   - Asks the user for an operation (+, -, *, /, or `q` to quit)
   - Accepts two numbers as input
   - Executes the operation and shows the result

3. The loop continues until the user types `q`.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand:
- ✅ Classes and object-oriented design in Python
- ✅ Working with loops and conditionals
- ✅ Handling user input and errors
- ✅ Using GitHub: forking, editing, and version control

---

## 🚀 My Enhancements

- Rewrote and organized the README file
- Improved code structure and usability
- Practiced GitHub collaboration through forking and pull requests
